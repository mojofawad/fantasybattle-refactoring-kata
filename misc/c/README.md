This is a C translation. The production code in "src" is in C.

For test code there are several options: 

* test-catch2 - tests in C++ with [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) and [ApprovalTests](https://github.com/approvals/approvaltests.cpp)
* test-cmocka - tests in C with the [CMocka framework](https://api.cmocka.org/)
* test-gtest - tests in C++ with [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and [ApprovalTests](https://github.com/approvals/approvaltests.cpp)
